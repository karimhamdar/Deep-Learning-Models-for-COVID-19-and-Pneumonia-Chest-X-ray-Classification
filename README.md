# Deep-Learning-Models-for-COVID-19-and-Pneumonia-Chest-X-ray-Classification

This project focuses on evaluating deep learning models for the classification of chest X-rays into three categories: COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal. The pandemic highlighted the importance of quick, reliable diagnostic tools, and this study compares three architecturesâ€”ResNet, DenseNet, and custom CNNs. Preprocessing techniques like resizing and padding, along with data augmentation, were used to improve model robustness. The results provide insights into the performance of these models in healthcare diagnosis, helping optimize patient care and resource allocation.

## We evaluated the following models:

ResNet: A residual learning framework that helps prevent vanishing gradients in deep networks.
DenseNet: A model that connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion, promoting feature reuse.
Custom CNN: A tailored convolutional neural network designed specifically for the dataset to optimize performance on this classification task.
Each model was tested using different preprocessing and data augmentation techniques to improve classification accuracy and robustness.
